# Backend Project - Spring Boot Application

This repository contains the backend for quePasa, a private chat messaging application. It is built with **Spring Boot** and runs on **Java 21**. The application handles authentication, authorization, and communication with the frontend through REST APIs.

The backend uses a PostgreSQL to store data, and starting the application automatically runs the required services via **Docker Compose**.

## Features

- **Authentication & Authorization:** Manages JWT-based login and registration.
- **REST APIs:** Seamless communication with the frontend application.
- **Spring Boot Framework:** Fast, secure, and scalable backend.
- **Docker Integration:** Easy deployment with Docker Compose.
